# passwordValidationForm
A simple form for username and password with a Javascript password validation function returning password strength.

To view the code, simply clone or fork the project, open in your IDE. 

Open Index.html in a browser to view the page (Chrome recommended).

Feel free to type in a username and password, you will be given feedback on the strength of your password. Go over and enter a new password to go again. Once you have a strong password you'll be able to hit the register button!

The design meets the brief for look in terms of computer screen. As an extra feature I have added in responsive layouts for tablet and mobile screen sizes.
